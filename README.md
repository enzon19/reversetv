## About

Ever wondered where else you've seen that actor? With ReverseTV, you can instantly discover other appearances of every actor from the movies or shows you've watched based on your Trakt history.

Just open any title, and ReverseTV will show a list of all the other productions each actor has been in that you already watched.

ReverseTV uses the Trakt API to fetch your history and TMDB API to get the cast and compare datas.
